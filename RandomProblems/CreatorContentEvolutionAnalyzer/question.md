Question
YouTube’s analytics team is studying the evolution of tech content creators. They have historical data showing how creators’ content changes over time in terms of technical depth and entertainment value. Each video is rated on two scales: technical depth and entertainment value and each creator posts one video every week.

You have a dataset of 100 creators spread across 52 weeks. Each line in the dataset contains <tech value, entertainment value> of previous video and <tech value, entertainment value> of the next video posted by the same creator. Analyzing this shows will show you how the content evolves over time.

Now, you are given a different list of 30 creators and their current state of content <tech value, entertainment value>. Now among these 30 creators figure out,

the creator, to have highest technical depth after 4 weeks
the creator, to have highest entertainment value after 4 weeks
the creators who switched from tech-focused to entertainment-focused and from entertainment-focused to more tech-focused
You can output the index of the creator in the list of 30 creators (starting with 0).
